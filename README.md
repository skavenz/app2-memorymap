# Tonk App

Welcome to the 2nd mini app of FLUX.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project is a privacy-focused map-based journaling app built using the Tonk toolchain. Users can drop pins on a map to record how they felt at a specific location and time, adding a “vibe”, a written memory, and optionally an image. Designed to operate without Web3 or external APIs, the app runs entirely within a secure, decentralised Web2 environment powered by Tonk. It integrates with other mini-apps like a mood board and calendar, all sharing data through Tonk nodes. The goal is to enable personal expression, mood tracking, and memory storage while prioritising data ownership and user privacy.
